The project is attached with .yml file and a test_video for your ref , so that you atleast run a demo

the file paths are hardcoded!!! so in case you run make sure you change paths

Thanx

to upgrade pip version -
pip install --upgrade pip


1.pandas - 
pip install pandas 

pandas is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with structured
(tabular, multidimensional, potentially heterogeneous) and time series data both easy and intuitive.
It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python.

Haarcascade -

*****************************************************************************************************

Haarcascade - 
Haar Cascade classifier is an effective object detection approach which was proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones
This is basically a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of images both positive and negative.
Based on the training it is then used to detect the objects in the other images.

Face Detection: it has the objective of finding the faces (location and size) in an image and probably extract
them to be used by the face recognition algorithm.

Face Recognition: with the facial images already extracted, cropped, resized and usually converted to grayscale
the face recognition algorithm is responsible for finding characteristics which best describe the image.

**********************************************************************************************************

Local Binary Pattern (LBP) is a simple yet very efficient texture operator which labels the pixels of an
image by thresholding the neighborhood of each pixel and considers the result as a binary number.

the LBPH uses 4 parameters:

Radius: the radius is used to build the circular local binary pattern and represents the radius around the central pixel. It is usually set to 1.

Neighbors: the number of sample points to build the circular local binary pattern. Keep in mind: the more sample points you include, the higher the computational cost. It is usually set to 8.

Grid X: the number of cells in the horizontal direction. The more cells, the finer the grid, the higher the dimensionality of the resulting feature vector. It is usually set to 8.

Grid Y: the number of cells in the vertical direction. The more cells, the finer the grid, the higher the dimensionality of the resulting feature vector. It is usually set to 8.

LBPH is one of the easiest face recognition algorithms.
It can represent local features in the images.
It is possible to get great results (mainly in a controlled environment).
It is robust against monotonic gray scale transformations.
It is provided by the OpenCV library (Open Source Computer Vision Library).
